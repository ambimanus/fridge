# fridge
Simulation of populations of adaptive, controllable fridge devices written in Java. This is my masters thesis project, the topic was "modelling and evaluation of desynchronization strategies for controllable cooling devices".

The code contains the fridge simulation models and a bunch of controller classes, including the developed desynchronization strategies. There is a CLI starter, a GUI version, and a JWS version. Also, the experiment configurations used in the thesis (and some more) are provided.

Beware, this is from 2008 :)
